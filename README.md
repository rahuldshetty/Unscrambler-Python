# Unscrambler-Python
A Python script to get proper anagrams for a string.

# Implementation
I used python dictionary to store sorted string as key and all the anagrams in that key's list. Used the same to retrieve back. The dictionary is loaded with words from [here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)

# Usage
 1. Use 'load.py' toc reate the dictionary and save it using pickle.
 2. Run 'find.py' to load the saved dictionary and use the app to search.
